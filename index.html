However, what one can build on top of an open citation graph vastly exceeds the value of free-to-read citation data. In this talk, I introduce the Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC) and present a key example of reuse and remix of open citation data in Wikidata — the free knowledge base that anyone can edit. With its open human and algorithmic curation model, Wikidata allows embedding bibliographic and citation datasets in a much richer set of relations compared to most citation indexes. It supports novel use cases that go beyond bibliometric analysis and thanks to its open nature it makes gaps and quality issues in the underlying citation data easily auditable.</section></td></tr>

The mission of Europe PMC is to make the content as widely available as possible, which we do via the website, APIs and bulk downloads. Built in partnership with PMC USA, with whom the full text articles are shared, Europe PMC adds value to the core content in a number of ways, one of which is to generate article-level citation counts. These are generated via the references lists from the full text article in Europe PMC, supplemented with reference lists from Crossref metadata services. With the formation of IO4C, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of citations we have been able to add to the Europe PMC network, data that we redistribute via the website and APIs. In this talk I will describe how Europe PMC manages, distributes and reuses open citations.</section></td></tr>

After discussing problems with commercial citation indexes – cost, data availability, visualization tools, and variation in citation statistics – I will mention recent initiatives to reclaim citations for the world of open scholarship: The Initiative for Open Citations, Crossref as a reference repository, WikiCite, OpenCitations as a scholarly infrastructure organization, and the OpenCitations Corpus. I will introduce a formal definition of an open citation, and will outline the the SPAR (Semantic Publishing and Referencing) ontologies and OpenCitations Data Model that we at OpenCitations have developed to facilitate the creation of machine-readable open citation data. I will then describe the requirements for citations to be treated as first-class data entities, and the new global persistent identifier for citations that we have developed, the Open Citation Identifier (OCI), and will conclude by showing how OCIs can be used to create simple citation indexes of open citation sources such as the Crossref Open Citations Index.</section></td></tr>

The shortage of citation data for the international and German social sciences is well known to researchers in the bibliometrics field and has itself often been subject to academic studies. In order to open up citation data in the social sciences, the EXCITE project develops a set of algorithms for the extraction of citation and reference information from PDF documents and the matching of reference strings against bibliographic databases. The presentation focuses on the overall reference extraction, matching and publication workflows and tool chain. A demo of the web demonstrator completes the talk.</section></td></tr>

In this context, hyperlinks are the preferred way to reference published or unpublished sources, including datasets and software. While hyperlinks are more powerful than text-based citations in terms of user experience, they are prone to link rot. Shortened URLs add an extra level of indirection that increases the risk of breaking the permanent record of science. Cobaltmetrics monitors trusted sources to index citations, identifiers, and hyperlinks. We go deeper than other altmetrics providers. We mine data in 180+ languages, we unroll shortened URLs from 175+ shorteners, we crack open URLs to extract persistent identifiers, and we convert between 50+ types of identifiers. We will provide empirical data from an analysis of 73.5 millions documents, 52.5 million citations and backlinks, and a database of 6.5 billion shortened URLs, focusing on the effects of reference rot on altmetrics indicators. We will then present good practices that all stakeholders should adopt and, most importantly, technical solutions that altmetrics providers should implement to compensate the effects of link rot and URL variability.</section></td></tr>

Problematic citation patterns include the selective citation of positive findings, citation bias, as well as the continued citation of retracted literature (i.e. literature formally withdrawn due to error, fraud, or ethical problems). For instance, there is some evidence that positive results tend to receive more citations.The public domain licensing of the Open Citations Corpus makes it possible, in principle, to estimate the likelihood that any network of research papers suffers from problematic citation. To-date, problematic citation been documented ad-hoc, in several striking studies. In Alzheimer's disease research, biased citation, ignoring critical findings, was used to support successful U.S. NIH grant proposals (Greenberg 2009). Mistranslation of obesity research has been used to justify exertion game research (Marshall &amp; Linehan 2017). Citation of fraudulent research about Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease continued after its retraction (Fulton et al. 2015). The data resulting from such studies is of great use to my lab in replicating and determining how to generalize the detection of problematic citation patterns. Previously, the detection of problematic citation patterns has been a side effect of astute researchers, noticing suspicious findings while conducting systematic literature reviews. This talk will describe work-in-progress in my lab detecting problematic citation patterns using natural language processing, combined with network analysis on the Open Citations Corpus.</section></td></tr>

We have started the Linked Open Citation Database (LOC-DB) project to enable libraries to contribute to the creation and curation of open citations. We provide an interface for librarians to incrementally catalog citation metadata with low effort. The librarians are supported by a wide range of helpful tools such as a reference extractor for print as well as digital documents along with a suggestion engine, which harvests external data sources for citation candidates. The database itself is prepared for distributed deployment, such that multiple libraries can collaborate. At any time, the data can be supplied as linked data in the OpenCitations data format. The goal is to show that efficiently cataloging citations of print and electronic resources in libraries is possible. In the presentation, we’ll describe the current state of the workflow and its implementation. We show that automatic reference extraction from scanned print resources could be significantly improved with the implementation of an automatic reference extraction component based on deep learning-based approach.

Simultaneously, we should be concerned as well with another complementary issue, that is the necessity to "recover" citation data from  digitized publications. This applies especially to the Humanities, where fields often have century-long traditions. Otherwise, we risk to create citation indexes that take into account only recent publications, mostly in English, while a gap ensues for citations buried in older publications. The creation of a comprehensive citation index for the Arts and Humanities, however, is a titanic endeavour which can only be accomplished with a collaborative, distributed approach, where cultural heritage institutions (e.g. libraries, archives, etc.) play a key role. In this talk we present The Venice Scholar, a citation index of literature on the history of Venice, indexing nearly 3000 volumes of scholarship from the mid 19th century to 2013, from which some 4 million bibliographic references have been extracted. The Venice Scholar, to be publicly launched in September 2018, is the first running instance of the Scholar Index, a platform aimed at creating a comprehensive citation index for the Arts and Humanities. This platform consists of two applications, the Scholar Library (SL) and the Scholar Index (SI), both to be released soon under an open source license.The SL is a digital library system where partner institutions can load their digitized scholarly literature. The system embeds the necessary machine learning components to recognize the text from an image (OCR), extract references and link them to unique identifiers, pointing to external resources (e.g. library catalogues). Each partner institution keeps an instance of the digital library system and its own collection.The SI is the global citation index, which federates all citations extracted from different institutions into a unique index, and provides a rich search interface to navigate through the resulting network of citations, with the final aim of interlinking digital archives and digital libraries. In fact, the SI is currently being extended, thanks to an Europeana Reserach Grant, to provide contextual recommendations of related digital objects from Europeana to its users. The citation data underlying the Venice Scholar are modelled using the OpenCitations Data Model, and will use the OpenCitations Corpus as its publication platform, thus enriching this corpus with some 4 million references "recovered" from historical and current publications about the history of Venice. To conclude, we believe that the creation of a citation index for Arts and Humanities can only be accomplished through a collaborative and federated approach, and by leveraging infrastructure synergies, such as the one with the Open Citation Corpus. In this process, libraries and other institutions should take responsibility for specific areas of knowledge (e.g. a journal, a publisher, or a topic) and, at the same time, be facilitated (e.g. through software) in the task of enriching their digitized collections with citation data.</section></td></tr>

Networks of citations can trace the genealogy of ideas, and through reference lists one can see methods, theories, and ideologies introduced and die away. Until recently, the references of an article were under strict copyright control and tracking citations was left up to big business, but the open science movement has started to change that. New initiatives such at the I4OC Initiative for Open Citations are spearheading a growing consensus that citations are metadata and therefore should be freely accessible via Crossref, regardless of article license type. The discovery platform ScienceOpen is a case study in the kind of search environment that can be built on top of an open citations commons. ScienceOpen recently added over 100 million citation connections between articles, and uses its powerful search engine to expose this knowledge to researchers for a richer discovery experience. This enables us to provide users with tools to track their own article citations through time, trace citation networks, discover similar articles, discover highly-cited articles in a research field, sort searches by citations, and ultimately create a vast, contextual citation-based network for an intelligent search and discovery experience. ScienceOpen provides a good example of your open citations – and open science in action.</section></td></tr>

At the same time, their development shows both the power and limitations of established parties, restricting their potential use for the wider scholarly community. For example, the quality of open citations as metadata provided by publishers is often still suboptimal. It can be argued that stricter requirements as to the format and quality of such metadata would discourage publishers from supplying them in the first place (thus slowing the growth of the number of open citations made available). In combinaton with limiting the supply of open citation metadata to publishers, though, a catch-22 situation is created that limits the quality of open citations, and thus, their usability. Simultaneously, commercial parties have ingested these incomplete metadata and improved on them, only to subsequently monetize their use in applications without contributing back to the underlying corpus of open data. While there is rightly no limitation on the use and reuse of open citations, I would like to explore models that would better allow the scholarly community to contribute to the quality and value of open citations metadata on one hand, and encourage  their sustainable use on the other hand. The former could be envisioned through forms of crowdsourced improvement of open citations metadata (in which Wikidata could play an important role). An example of the latter would be the monetization of services built on enriched open citation data, without enclosing the data itself. Both models would enable the scholarly community as a whole to not only make optimal use of open citations, but also contribute to their value. By making the wheels turn smoother, we'll collectively get further!</section></td></tr>

Since 2012, Russian policies in the higher education sphere were largely directed by the results of the Survey of efficiency of higher education organizations (Monitoring of Efficiency of Educational Organizations) – a set of quantitative performance indicators used to sort efficient from non-efficient organizations. There are also several governmental programs for funding best universities, one of them is “5–top 100” started in 2013. Most of those initiatives include assessment of publication activity. Searchers showed that this funding programs had positive effects on publication activity (Turko, 2016) and there are also studies about collaborations for most citied papers (Pislyakov, 2014). Those studies mostly focused on successful universities and its specific characteristics. Many universities are closely connected to small number of fields and currently used bibliographic metrics do not consider this difference between publication dynamics across fields (Piro, 2014). The main purpose of our study to show how representation of universities in different citation systems depends on such factors as: public or private; localized in a bigger city or a wealthy region; nominal profile (based partly on ties to specific fields); age;  ecological situation at a local market for higher education. For purposes of our study we used data collected from Monitoring of Efficiency 2013-2017 which include (per 100 academic employees): Number of citations in Web of Science, Number of citations in Scopus, Number of citations in Russian Scientific Citation Index, Number of publications in Web of Science, Number of publications in Scopus, Number of publications in Russian Scientific Citation Index. Our study shows that facing publication pressures universities have a stable positive trend in number of publications but our data shows that extreme variability of bibliographic metrics exist between different university families. Thus, so-called “classical”, polytechnic and medical universities have higher median number of publication in Web of Science that others, while universities majoring in social and economic sciences, especially ones attached to various ministries have the highest median number of publication in Russian Scientific Citation Index. The results show that the ascriptive variables account for a large share of variance, with families being particularly important.</p> <p>References: Piro F. N., Aksnes D. W., Rørstad K.

Using openly-available citation data, it constructs and visualises the local citation network in the researcher’s area, helping them discover literature they may have missed and make sense of how papers are connected.Why is this so useful? Traditionally, the literature review process has involved iteratively searching keyword combinations and manually following references from one paper at a time. With this method it’s easy for important papers to slip through the net and is difficult to prioritise what to read first.How does it work? Gecko circumvents the need for researchers to define their area of interest in keywords by simply starting with a set of ‘seed papers’ which are representative of their area of interest. Gecko then finds all the papers that a) cite, b) are cited-by, or c) are co-cited with the seed papers in order to build a ‘localised’ citation network. Visualising this network gives researchers an overview of how the different papers fit together. Local, rather than global, metrics can then be defined on the network providing suggestions that are more likely to relevant to the researcher. New seed papers can then be added on-the-go from among the results, expanding the network and building up a more complete map of the literature. Citation Gecko is designed to fit with a researcher’s workflow, integrating with reference managers such as Zotero directly and allowing for upload of bibtex files, as well as providing native search functions. By demonstrating how having open citations can lead to greater discoverability of research articles we hope to incentivise more publishers to open up their citation data.</section></td></tr>

In order to automatically and accurately extract and parse difference kinds of references, EXCITE proposes a generic approach that combines Random Forest and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) in a coherent mechanism. Random Forest is employed for the initial classification of each line in the document, whereas CRF parses the potential reference lines into essential components (e.g., author, title, etc.).

It is funded by the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Ad-ministration (RANEPA, <a href="http://www.ranepa.ru/eng/">http://www.ranepa.ru/eng/</a>). The project has two main aims: 1) to create a public service for processing available research papers full text (particularly, in PDF and with main focus on Social Sciences), in order to build and regularly update an open dataset of citation relationships and citations content; 2) to use the citation content data for developing methods of qualitative citation analysis, which can be used for improving of current practice of a research performance assessment. The project tends to provide a pilot version of open scholarly infrastructure  based on following pillars:1.Open distributed architecture. It means providing a concept, open source software and an initial core infrastructure for interoperable systems, which are processing citation relationships and its content from research papers’ full text. 2. Two initial nodes of this core infrastructure, presented by interacting CitEc (<a href="http://citec.repec.org/">http://citec.repec.org/</a>) and CyrCitEc systems. Currently these nodes are ex-changing by citations data. The nodes have a specialization on processing papers in specific languages: Romano-Germanic languages by CitEc and Russian by CyrCitEc. Other nodes, e.g. specialized on processing citation data in languages, like Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, etc., can be added by the same way. There is also an intention to integrate data about references into the OpenCitations Corpus (<a href="http://opencitations.net/">http://opencitations.net/</a>).3. Transparency. It allows publishers, authors and readers of papers to see for each paper how their citation data are extracted by the system and to trace why some papers' references / in-text citations are not processed or not counted.4. Better representation and usability of citation data by its deeper integration with a digital library tools and services. 5. Enrichment facilities. The system provides tools for authors of papers to enter additional data to correct errors of processing citations from their papers and to enrich their citation relationships, e.g. by qualitative characteristics of their motivation for citing papers of other authors, etc.6. Public control. Readers of papers can see how authors used enrichment facilities to increase their number of citations. Public will be able to react on wrong authors behaviour. CyrCitEc takes papers’ metadata from the Socionet digital library (https://socionet.ru/), which also includes a full set of metadata from RePEc (<a href="http://repec.org">http://repec.org</a>).</section></td></tr>

The consortium consists of a number of non-profit organisations involved with academic publishing, originally drawn from the Cambridge (UK) area. The consortium meets regularly to discuss data science issues associated with publishing including topics as diverse as identifying usage patterns, gender bias, user experience and data repositories, and article level metrics. A subset of these members (Cambridge University Press, the Royal Society of Chemistry, PLoS, eLife and The Company of Biologists) decided to share data so that an analysis of the scientific validity could be undertaken. To attempt to ascertain scientific validity we looked at a multitude of measures used commonly used a variety of statistical methods to group them into sets of distinct factors. The results of the factor analysis where sets of metrics which measured different aspects of a papers impact. We found that while these patterns of impact are different across different publishers, there are clear commonalities in which metrics fall together. To identify the usefulness of these different sets of metrics we then aligned them with the measures identified through the snowball initiative. In this way, we have started to identify high-level metrics that are statistically distinct, in that they measure different phenomena, and are useful in that they are similar to measures independently proposed by a consortium of universities. We present the latest results from this ongoing project.</section></td></tr>

The author shows functionality of the new developed plugin (ScientoMiner ICR) for the Gephi analytical platform that imports data describing citations from CrossRef services.
